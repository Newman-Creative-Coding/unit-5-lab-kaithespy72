    /** Car
     * My company, Zoomster, makes 3 models of car at a single factory.
     * Each car has a VIN, a make, a model, and a license plate number.
     * I want to track the total number of cars I have produced, as well
     * as the number of cars of each model, and the total profits from
     * my factory.
     * <p>
     * The Speedster sells for  $102,000.00 
     * The Roadster  sells for  $206,000.00
     * The Cubester  sells for  $74,000.00
     * <p>
     * VIN: unique ID for each car. VIN starts at A10000 and increases 
     * by one for each sequential car produced by the company.
     * E.g.: Our first car, a Speedster, has VIN A10000. Our second car,
     * a Cubester, has VIN A10001. Our third car, a Speedster, has VIN 
     * A10002. After A99999, VIN becomes B10000.
     * <p>
     * make: the company that produced the car. Should be the same for 
     * each car produced by my company.
     * <p>
     * model: can be any of the 3 models of car that I produce: 
     * the Cubester, the Speedster, or the Roadster.
     * <p>
     * license plate number: remains blank until the car is purchased and 
     * registered by a customer. Should be able to be modified by a 
     * method accessible to the customer.
